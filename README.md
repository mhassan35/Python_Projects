Sure! Here are several different Python programming tasks at a basic level for you to work on. You can choose any of them, and feel free to share your code when you're ready for feedback.

### Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is even or odd.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for an integer.
- Check if the number is divisible by 2 (even) or not (odd).
- Print whether the number is even or odd.


### Task 2: Calculate the Factorial of a Number
Write a Python program to calculate the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for a number.
- Compute the factorial of the number.
- Print the result.


### Task 3: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a Python program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to `n` terms, where `n` is provided by the user. The Fibonacci sequence starts with `0` and `1`, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for a number `n`.
- Print the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.


### Task 4: Find the Largest of Three Numbers
Write a Python program that takes three numbers as input and determines the largest of the three.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user to input three numbers.
- Use conditional statements to find the largest number.
- Print the largest number.

### Task 5: Reverse a String
Write a Python program that takes a string input from the user and prints it in reverse order.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for a string.
- Reverse the string.
- Print the reversed string.

### Task 6: Count the Number of Vowels in a String
Write a Python program that counts the number of vowels in a given string.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for a string.
- Loop through each character of the string and check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
- Print the total count of vowels in the string.

### Task 7: Sum of Digits in a Number
Write a Python program that calculates the sum of digits of a number entered by the user.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for a number.
- Convert the number into a string and loop through each digit.
- Add up the digits and print the result.


### Task 8: Check if a Number is a Palindrome
Write a Python program that checks if the number entered by the user is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number (or word) that reads the same backward as forward.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for a number.
- Check if the number is equal to its reverse.
- Print whether the number is a palindrome or not.


### Task 9: Sum of Even Numbers in a Range
Write a Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers in a given range (from `1` to `n`, where `n` is provided by the user).

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for the number `n`.
- Loop through all numbers from `1` to `n` and check if the number is even.
- Print the sum of all even numbers in that range.


### Task 10: Multiplication Table
Write a Python program that displays the multiplication table for a number entered by the user.

**Steps:**
- Ask the user for a number.
- Print the multiplication table (1 to 10) for that number.
